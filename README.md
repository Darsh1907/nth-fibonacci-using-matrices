Finding nth factorial using Diagonalization of a matrix A and Powers of A

## First lets see what is Diagonalization of a matrix A :-

Consider a nxn matrix A having eigen values as λ1, λ2,......λn and X1, X2,.....Xn as the corresponding eigen vectors.
Then, we can define an eigen vector matrix S as follows: [X1 X2 ....  Xn] where every Xi is a column matrix (eigen vector).

We can now define a diagonal matrix D = *(S^-1)*A*S =

[λ1 0 0]\n
[0 λ2 0]\n
[0 0 λ3]\n
