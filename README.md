Finding nth factorial using Diagonalization of a matrix A and Powers of A

## First lets see what is Diagonalization of a matrix A :-

Consider a nxn matrix A having eigen values as λ1, λ2,......λn and X1, X2,.....Xn as the corresponding eigen vectors.
Then, we can define a matrix S as follows: [X1 X2 X3 X4 X5 X6]
